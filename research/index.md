Viruses are the smallest but most elegant organisms on this planet. In this group we apply our expertise in structural biology techniques, especially cryo-electron microscopy, to map the chemistry of viruses to their ecology and applications. The smallest viruses are some of our favorites: parvoviruses (such as AAV), circoviruses, and anelloviruses. We also leverage our expertise in cryoEM to collaborate with other groups to enable a structural view of the processes of life.

Dr. Kaelber's contributions to the field include developing the concept of using computational decoys to test structural hypotheses about a population of macromolecules imaged by cryoEM. This was first implemented to detect how many RdRp were inside the virion of a 9-segmented dsRNA virus. 

Recently, Dr. PÃ©nzes used cryoEM to discover the viral cause of an epidemic affecting superworm farms. The group is currently developing countermeasures to protect colonies from this affliction.

Two ongoing collaborations of especial note are: supporting the Ebright lab in uncovering the structural basis of processes in transcriptional control, and supporting the Slusky lab in design of peptides and peptidomimetics to plug transmembrane channels.

Below you can find examples of our findings pertaining to virus structure, virus evolution, cryo-EM methods, and structural biology. This list is collected and updated automatically by Manubot, a tool created by the Greene Lab. Because it is not human-curated on a reglar basis, it may omit some references and include extraneous references from time to time.
