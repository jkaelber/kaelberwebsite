Principal Investigator of the group. Associate Research Professor, Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine.

I love viruses.

I am a structural and evolutionary virologist at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. I launched my independent research program in 2019, focusing on two areas: on the structural biology of viruses—specifically viral gene therapy vectors—and on methods development for cryoEM. The first structure that we published from my lab—the AAVhu.37 capsid—was briefly a record-holder as it was of higher resolution than any other single-particle cryoEM structure from a 200-kilovolt instrument.

I began my classical and molecular virology training at Cornell in the laboratory of Prof. Colin Parrish, where I discovered that the global pandemic of parvovirus in dogs was derived from a virus whose ancestor infected ancient canids . After virology internships at Harvard (Prof. Welkin Johnson, now of Boston College) and the Institute Pasteur (Dr. Marco Vignuzzi, now of A*STAR), I moved to the Department of Molecular Virology & Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine (Prof. Wan Chou, now of Stanford) to focus on structural virology. In addition to basic research on the structural biology of viral replication and surveillance for new mosquito-borne viruses, I always made time to contribute to countermeasures-development programs such as a vaccine against chikungunya virus that is safe and effective in primates.

Since 2017, I lead the Rutgers CryoEM & Nanoimaging Facility (RCNF) and serve as a field expert in cryoelectron microscopy technologies for our state. Participating in investigator-initiated projects in a service capacity has helped me to stay current on best practices for cryoEM and I am proud of the capabilities of our well-maintained hardware, optimized workflows, and well-trained personnel.

Questions that drive me include: where did viruses come from, in the beginning? And how can we use knowledge of viruses to live longer, healthier, more beautiful lives?
